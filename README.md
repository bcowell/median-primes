- Frontend    React/Redux (bootstrapped with Create-React-App)
- Backend     Node/Express (babel to transpile ES6/7)

# TODO
- Bump nodejs versions for server

# How does it look?


# Getting Started
You must install both the client and server before you can run them.

## `yarn` or `yarn install`

# Available Scripts

In both directories, you can run:

## `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
The client runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).<br />
The server on [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

## `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

## `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
